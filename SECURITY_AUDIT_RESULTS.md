- **After**: Modern, configurable headers with security improvements
- **Implementation**: Secure header management in authentication service

### 3. **Inconsistent Error Handling** ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED

- **After**: `ErrorRecoveryManager` with specialized exception hierarchy
- **Implementation**:
  - ‚úÖ Specific exception types: `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`, `NetworkError`, etc.
  - ‚úÖ Context-aware error recovery strategies
  - ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
  - ‚úÖ Automatic retry with exponential backoff for appropriate error types
  - ‚úÖ No broad exception catching - all errors handled specifically

### 4. **Console Output in Production Code** ‚úÖ COMPLETELY ELIMINATED
- **Before**: 17+ `print()` statements in production code paths
- **After**: Professional logging framework with structured output
- **Result**: Zero console output statements, full logging level control
- **Verification**: Complete absence of print statements confirmed

## üü° Major Architectural Issues - STATUS: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 5. **Version Inconsistency** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Before**: Version mismatch between setup.py (0.3.3) and pyproject.toml (0.3.6)  
- **After**: Consistent v0.4.0 across all files
- **Files Synchronized**: `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `monarchmoney/__init__.py`

### 6. **Dual Package Management** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Status**: Both files maintained but with consistent configuration
- **Approach**: Modern `pyproject.toml` as primary, `setup.py` for compatibility
- **Result**: No packaging confusion, clear build process

### 7. **Hardcoded Magic Numbers** ‚úÖ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
- **Implementation**: Configuration constants with documentation
- **Examples**: Session validation intervals, retry parameters properly documented
- **Result**: Configurable timeouts and intervals

### 8. **Missing Input Validation** ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED
- **Before**: No validation on user inputs, API responses
- **After**: Comprehensive `InputValidator` class
- **Features**:
  - ‚úÖ Email validation with regex patterns
  - ‚úÖ Password strength validation  
  - ‚úÖ Amount/currency validation
  - ‚úÖ Date format validation
  - ‚úÖ GraphQL injection protection
  - ‚úÖ Response validation and sanitization

---

## üü† Code Quality Issues - STATUS: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 9. **Inconsistent Async Patterns** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Consistent async/await patterns throughout services
- **Result**: Clear execution model, no blocking operations in async contexts
- **Features**: Context manager support with proper cleanup

### 10. **Poor Test Structure** ‚úÖ IMPROVED  
- **Status**: 58/58 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Organization**: Tests organized with proper fixtures
- **Coverage**: All critical paths tested

### 11. **Method Naming Inconsistency** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Result**: Consistent snake_case for all Python methods
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy method names preserved for compatibility

### 12. **No Configuration Management** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Features**: Configuration classes for timeouts, retry counts, caching
- **Implementation**: Environment variable support, configurable parameters
